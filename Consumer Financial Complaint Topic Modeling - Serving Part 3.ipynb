A few years back, I called to ask them to move the due date to the last day of each month as that is a payday for me.  I was told not to worry about it, and that as long as my payment was made on the last day of the month, I would not be charged a late fee.  I logged in this morning to find out why my balance hasn't gone down much lately and I find that I've been charged  late fees, totaling $, in the last 2.5 years.  I called customer service this morning to try to alleviate the problem and was told that they would only waive  fees, unless I could tell them the exact date in which I spoke to the representative who informed me not to worry about the payment due date.  I obviously could not come up with the exact date from a few years ago.  There is no way that I would logically be OK with paying a late fee almost every month and not do anything about it.</td>\n",

It is a  bill outstanding from an account opened in 2009 in a city I did n't live in, with a different last name than mine as well as a different SS number. I called  and asked them use my name and SS and they did n't have any records of any accounts or outstanding bills. Into the picture comes Enhanced Recovery Company ( ERC ).
